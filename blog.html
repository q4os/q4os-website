        08 July, 2023
<!--           <div style="float:left"> -->
            <p>A brand new stable Q4OS 5.2 version codenamed 'Aquarius' is immediately available for download and use in production environments. This is a long-term support LTS version to be supported for at least five years with security patches and software updates. Q4OS Aquarius is based on Debian Bookworm 12 and Plasma 5.27.5, optionally Trinity 14.1 desktop environment, and it's available for 64bit/x64 computers. A 32bit/i686pae edition for older i386 systems with or without PAE extension will follow soon, in a few days. We plan to bring Aquarius for ARM devices as well.<br><br>The objective is to provide rock stable, as lightweight as possible, Debian based operating system with added value thanks to unique Q4OS tools. We keep the Plasma desktop appearance as the Debian stock one, however users who like Q4OS brand are recommended to switch to Q4OS dedicated Debonaire theme in system settings. Desktop profiler, an exclusive Q4OS tool, features custom profiles support, so a user can export the current desktop status snapshot, modify it and even create customized profiles on his own. Any profile is importable, so a user can import and apply it later on another hardware, getting a unique possibility of easy installation and configuration of the pre-defined set of applications and packages at once. In other words, a user easily gets a fresh operating system installation configured and ready to work with a minimal post installation effort. In addition, each desktop environment may keep its own applications profiles.<br><br>One of the Q4OS specific goals is the ability to keep Plasma and Trinity desktops alongside each other installed. Users can switch back and forth between more advanced Plasma or efficient Trinity desktop. Both desktops can independently coexist side by side and don't interfere with each other. Plasma is being the logical primary choice for most of users, so it's considered to be the default option, which is also obvious from the Q4OS downloads site.<br><br>The primary Q4OS aim is stability. We want to provide as stable as possible operating system for companies as well as for individuals. Once installed and configured, Q4OS will work reliably in a long standing way, getting security fixes and updates. Adopting a new feature into the core system could be committed in a highly exceptional cases only. We treat such possible cases as best as possible, doing testing and investigating consequences carefully before such a change.<br><br>We promise to keep Q4OS free for everyone forever.

            <p>A significant update to the Q4OS Gemini testing version is available for download, you can find 64bit iso image at the dedicated <a href="downloads2.html">Testing releases</a> site. Anybody is invited to try it out and report bugs and glitches.<br><br>This release brings some significant changes and improvements, the most important one is that Plasma and Trinity desktops are even more separated by default. That means Trinity main repositories are no more included within Plasma systems by default, however the option to operate Trinity and Plasma desktop side by side is still enabled, even supported. So users have an option to explicitly ask Desktop profiler tool to add Trinity repositories, and install it alongside Plasma. We are working to improve the Desktop profiler to make possible to create custom profiles in an easy way, use local, as well as remote desktop profiles and other advanced features. Another important change is a move to the just new Trinity desktop 14.0.8 development version.<br><br>All dependencies from the current stable Q4OS Centaurus edition has been removed, so Gemini now becomes fully independent getting its own repositories and dependencies. Q4OS 4.1 Gemini is based on the current Debian 'Bullseye' development branch, it will be in development until Debian Bullseye becomes stable, and will be supported at least five years from the official release date.</p>
