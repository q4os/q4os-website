        <h4>Q4OS 6 ARM edition</h4>
        15 December, 2025
<!--           <div style="float:left"> -->
            <p>We are introducing a brand new port of Q4OS designed for use on a variety of ARM devices. Q4OS 6.4 Andromeda on ARM architecture is a free operating system based on Debian Trixie and Trinity desktop environment 14.1.5 stable. It runs on a wide range of hardware equipped with different 64bit ARM processors, including Chromebooks, tablets, single board computers, embedded devices and more. Q4OS on ARM devices runs fast and is pretty snappy.<br><br>Q4OS is one of the few distributions that offers a full featured desktop on ARM architecture. If you want to install Q4OS on your ARM device, please follow <a href="https://www.q4os.org/forum/viewtopic.php?id=5840">Q4OS on ARM</a> instructions.</p>

        <h4>Q4OS 6.1 Andromeda, stable</h4>
        12 September, 2025
<!--           <div style="float:left"> -->
            <p>After a year of heavy development and testing, we are pleased to announce the release of the brand-new stable Q4OS 6.1 operating system, codenamed 'Andromeda'. It is now available for download and is recommended for use in production environments. Andromeda is a long-term support (LTS) release and will be supported with free security patches and software updates for at least five years. We are even considering another five years of commercial support following the Debian upstream approach, so the total life cycle of Andromeda may extend up to 10 years.<br><br>Q4OS Andromeda is based on Debian Trixie 13.1 and Plasma 6.3.6, optionally Trinity 14.1.5 desktop environment, and it's immediately available for 64bit/x64 computers. An ARM64 version is also planned for later. According to Debian upstream, the 32-bit/i386 Andromeda edition will not be available. However, we recommend using Q4OS-5 Aquarius for older i386 systems. We will continue to offer three years of support for the 32-bit version of Aquarius until June 2028.<br><br>We intentionally keep the Plasma desktop appearance as the stock one, however those who love Q4OS brand should switch to Q4OS's dedicated "Debonaire" theme in the system settings. It's a simple step and you get Q4OS stylish look-and-feel of your desktop session.<br><br>Stability, consistence, lightness, are our top priority. Q4OS offers a stable, Debian based operating system with added value thanks to unique tools. The Desktop profiler, an exclusive Q4OS tool, features custom profiles. This allows users to export the current desktop status snapshot, modify it and even create own customized profiles. Each profile is importable, allowing users to use it later on different hardware and getting a unique ability of easy installation and configuration of the predefined set of applications and packages at once. In other words, with minimal effort, a fresh customized operating system is quickly up and running.<br><br>A Q4OS-specific goal is the ability to install and use Plasma and Trinity desktops side by side. Users can switch back and forth between more advanced Plasma or efficient Trinity desktop. Both desktops can independently coexist side by side without interfering with each other. Plasma is being the logical primary choice for most of users and is therefore considered the default option, which is also obvious on the Q4OS downloads site.<br><br>Our team strives to provide businesses as well as individuals with the most stable operating system possible. Once installed and configured, Q4OS runs reliably in a long standing way, getting security fixes and updates. Adopting new features into the basic system would be committed in a highly exceptional cases only. We handle such cases as cautiously as possible, investigating consequences and conducting testing before implementing such changes.<br><br>We promise to keep Q4OS for free for everyone forever :) Enjoy the operating system and feel free to download installation media images from the <a href="downloads1.html">Downloads section of the Q4OS website</a>.</p>

            <p>A significant update to the Q4OS Gemini testing version is available for download, you can find 64bit iso image at the dedicated <a href="downloads2.html">Testing releases</a> site. Anybody is invited to try it out and report bugs and glitches.<br><br>This release brings some significant changes and improvements, the most important one is that Plasma and Trinity desktops are even more separated by default. That means Trinity main repositories are no more included within Plasma systems by default, however the option to operate Trinity and Plasma desktop side by side is still enabled, even supported. So users have an option to explicitly ask Desktop profiler tool to add Trinity repositories, and install it alongside Plasma. We are working to improve the Desktop profiler to make possible to create custom profiles in an easy way, use local, as well as remote desktop profiles and other advanced features. Another important change is a move to the just new Trinity desktop 14.0.8 development version.<br><br>All dependencies from the current stable Q4OS Centaurus edition has been removed, so Gemini now becomes fully independent getting its own repositories and dependencies. Q4OS 4.1 Gemini is based on the current Debian 'Bullseye' development branch, it will be in development until Debian Bullseye becomes stable, and will be supported at least five years from the official release date.</p>
